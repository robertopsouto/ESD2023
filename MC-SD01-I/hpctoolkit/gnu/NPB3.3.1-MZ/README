NAS Parallel Benchmarks 3.3, Multi-Zone Versions
-------------------------------------------------

For the description of the benchmarks, please refer to

The current distribution contains the following implementations:

   NPB3.3-MZ-SER:  a serial version
   NPB3.3-MZ-MPI:  a hybrid MPI + OpenMP version
   NPB3.3-MZ-OMP:  a nested OpenMP version

See individual README files in the corresponding directory
for details on compilation and execution.  Revision history
is given in Changes.log.

Version 3.3 no longer includes the SMP+OpenMP implementation of
the benchmarks.  Please download Version 3.2 instead if needed or
use the nested OpenMP version.

Attempts have been made to merge vector codes into the 3.3 release,
which can be selected with the VERSION=VEC option during compilation. 
However, successful vectorization highly depends on the compiler 
used.  Some changes to compiler directives for vectorization in 
the current codes may be required.


Version 3.2+ includes two new classes of problem: E and F, to stress
very large parallel computer systems.  Class E is about 20 times as
large as Class D, and Class F is about 20 times as large as Class E.
