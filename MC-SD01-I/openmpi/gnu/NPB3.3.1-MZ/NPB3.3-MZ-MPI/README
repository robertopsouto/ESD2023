This is the hybrid MPI+OpenMP implementation of the multi-zone
NAS Parallel Benchmarks.  For detail descriptions of the benchmarks,
please see:

   nas-03-010-abstract.html


For benchmark compilation and runtime setup, please refer to
README.install included in the directory.

This file briefly summarizes features and changes made in
different releases of the hybrid versions.


NPB 3.3.1-MZ-MPI

  * Fixed a missing argument bug in calling MPI_Abort().

  * Implemented a simple block distribution of zones to MPI processes
    in SP-MZ and LU-MZ.  This might improve performance of the two 
    benchmarks in some cases.


NPB 3.3-MZ-MPI

  * Merged vector codes into the release.  The vector version
    can be selected with VERSION=VEC during compilation.

  * Improved cache performance for the SP-MZ benchmark

  * Minor bug fix in mpi_setup.f for mismatched arguments


NPB 3.2-MZ-MPI

  * Introduced two new classes of problem: E and F

  * Added "SCHEDULE(STATIC)" to the OpenMP layer of hybrid versions

  * Minor optimization to the communication buffers in MPI versions

  * Fixed a data flush bug for pipeline in LU-MZ


NPB 3.1-MZ-MPI

  * Allow variable number of threads for individual processes and 
    define processor group for each process.

  * Report total number of threads (instead of threads-per-process). 

  * Use accurate surface term in MFLOPS calculation to take into 
    account non-square zone faces.

  * Improvements for LU-MZ:
      - Added one SSOR iteraction before timing loop to touch data 
        pages and code section.
      - Improved the memory usage for array 'tv'
      - Made rhs and erhs more cache-friendly.

  * Print built-in timers for all processes
